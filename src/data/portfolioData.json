The Admin is also able to manage the collaborators. The only thing the collaborators can't do that Admin can is add new or delete collaborators. Both Login is in the same Login landing page (/login). Me and my project partner were requested to do this project by a psychologist from Braga, Portugal, as a matter of fact, it is on use ever since the deployment.",
